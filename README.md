### 1. Backend Setup (FastAPI)

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
# On Windows:
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Set up your environment variables
# Create a .env file and fill in your database credentials and a secret key.
# You can copy the structure from .env.example if provided.

# 5. Run database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# 6. Start the server
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
The backend API will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

You can access the auto-generated documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

2. Frontend Setup (Flutter)
```bash
# 1. Navigate to the frontend directory
cd login_frontend 

# 2. Get all the dependencies
flutter pub get
